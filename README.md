# Soft-Neutral Life Binder Formatting Prompt

When generating any **.docx**, **Google-Docs-ready text**, or **printable long-form document**, always apply the following formatting rules by default.

This standard is designed for **life binders, planners, routines, reflections, trackers, and worksheets**.
The goal is **calm, breathable, supportive** — never busy, rigid, or overwhelming.

---

## Fonts

* Use **Montserrat** for all text:

  * Titles
  * Headings
  * Body text
  * Bullets
  * Captions
* No font substitutions.

---

## Color Use

* Headings only: **Muted blue** (RGB **32, 76, 141** or closest match)
* Body text: dark gray or soft black
* Use color sparingly and gently

Blue is for guidance, not dominance.

---

## Title Block

**Title**

* Montserrat
* SemiBold
* Blue
* ~16 pt

**Subtitle**

* Montserrat
* Regular
* Blue or dark gray
* ~13–14 pt
* Placed directly under the title

---

## Headings

**Heading 1**

* Montserrat
* Medium or SemiBold
* Blue
* ~13 pt

**Heading 2**

* Montserrat
* Medium
* Blue or dark gray
* ~12 pt

If content feels emotionally heavy, prefer dark gray over blue.

---

## Body Text & Spacing

* Font size: **11 pt**
* Line spacing: **1.0**
* Paragraph spacing:

  * **8 pt after**
  * **0 pt before**
* Favor white space over density
* Keep paragraphs short (1–2 lines)

---

## Bullets & Lists

* Use circle bullets only: **•**
* Never use hyphens or dashes
* Minimal nesting
* Bullets should feel optional, not commanding

Example tone:
• Gentle focus
• One small supportive step
• Optional if energy allows

---

## Page Structure

Preferred flow for most pages:

**Title → Gentle Context → Focus Area → Simple Prompts → Optional Actions → Reflection / Notes**

Avoid rigid sequences unless required for a tracker.

---

## Trackers & Check-Ins

* Use light tables or clearly spaced sections
* Language should feel supportive, not demanding
* Preferred phrasing:

  * “What felt good”
  * “What I want less of”
  * “One small step”
* Checkboxes:

  * ☐ gentle intention
  * ☐ optional task
  * ☐ done is enough

---

## Language Rules

* Avoid urgency language
* Do not use: *must*, *should*, *catch up*
* Prefer:

  * “You might”
  * “If it feels supportive”
  * “Optional”
  * “When you’re ready”

This system supports life — it does not manage it.

---

## Margins & White Space

* Standard US Letter margins
* Do not fill pages edge-to-edge
* Pages may feel intentionally “unfinished”

---

## Design Intention

This formatting should create documents that feel like a **quiet place to return to**, not another system asking for performance.
